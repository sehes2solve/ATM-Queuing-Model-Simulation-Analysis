Task #4 {Submit in the week starting 13th April}

In the lecture you saw the the 2 ATM case-study
Now, you are asked to develop a program to simulate the 3 ATM case study (multi-server queuing model). 

Required statistics:
Average waiting time
Probability of waiting 
Probability of waiting more than 1 minute
Maximum waiting time
Utilization of the first ATM machine
Utilization of the second ATM machine
Utilization of the third ATM machine

In this case, you have the following assumptions:
3 ATM machines (i.e. 3 servers)
A single queue for all 3 serves
Inter-arrival time follows an exponential distribution (mean = 1 minute).
Service time of the first ATM machine: uniform distribution (minimum value = 2 minutes & maximum value = 4 minutes).
Service time of the second ATM machine: triangular distribution (a = 2 minutes, b = 4 minutes & c =3.3 minutes).
Service time of the third ATM machine: normal distribution (mean = 3 minutes, standard deviation = 0.5 minutes).
Run the model for 1 million customers.

Good Luck
